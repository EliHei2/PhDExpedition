My all-time faviorite math prof once called me "a pseudo-scientist", "you are curious about so many problems, but you know nothing!", he said. He was indeed a genious, I find no definition of myself better than this. Here, I will share my very personal experineces, aha- and duh moments, scientefic breaktrhoughs, and brain bugs with the "public". This is more of a personal experiment rather than something necessarily useful for the public.
